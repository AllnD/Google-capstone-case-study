## 2. PREPARE ##
<p> 2.1 Data Source<p>
The datasets provided are available as public domain license listed as Kaggle: Fitbit Fitness Data stored as 18csv files. The information is made available via a survey by Amazon Mechanical Turk between 3rd to 5 December 2016. 30 Fitbit users consented to the submission and use of personal tracker data which includes detailed activity such as heart rate, daily activity, steps taken and sleep monitoring.

<p> 2.2.	Limitations <p>
This data is outdated as it was done in 2016. Also it only involves a small sampling size of 30 people which hardly represents the fitness community. In terms of ROCCC, it is fairly low. There is also a lack of information on water intact which might reduce the effectiveness of the recommendations on one of Bellabeat’s product which is spring. It was also evident that some data were missing such as weight log which only list 8 users, as not all users log their data. It is highly likely that the outcome of this analysis will be skewed as the data sets are of poor quality.
